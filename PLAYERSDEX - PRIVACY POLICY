</details>

**The instance is guaranteed to be running an exact copy of the code made open source.** The version may not be the latest available (check `/about`), but no local changes will be made. This may change, but users should be notified in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HmSMT4WKKV) about such change.

You may check the source code and see how the data is managed, in addition to the following policy.

## What data is collected

**PlayersDex** collects the following data from Discord:

- **User IDs**: This is used to identify you inside our database.
- **Server (or guild) IDs**: This is used to store settings necessary to the bot's operation.
- **Channel IDs**: This is used to know in which channel the collectibles should spawn.

In addition, the following data specific to **PlayersDex** is created and used:

- **The list of collectibles owned by a user** of the service.
- **A history of trades** done on collectibles, including the users that once owned the said collectible but do not anymore.

## How the data is stored

All data is stored on a PostgreSQL server, running on a Virtual Private Machine hosted by Oracle Corporation.

Interaction between the bot and the database server is exclusively local using [Tortoise ORM](https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm).

## Access to the data

The only persons allowed to access the data are the **application owners**.

Any **application owner** may interact with the bot and the administrator interface. Only **Alfx10#0260** has direct access to the host machine.

The **PlayersDex moderation teams** do not have access to the data.

The data may never be made available to the public, and its access must be secured accordingly.

## Your rights

You may request a copy or the deletion of your personal data held by the application by contacting the **application owners**. The recommended way is sending an email to "playersdex (at) alfx10 (dot) red". You may find other means of contact [here](https://gist.github.com/alfx10/52ae099c55c6ee1320a260b0a3ecac4e#contact).
